# ParticleNetFromMiniAODAK8

This folder contains the ONNX models for the `ParticleNetFromMiniAODAK8` network, which performs jet tagging for heavy resonances with merged decay products
(bb, cc, tautau vs. QCD) and resonance mass regression. The training sample consists of about 30M jets, sampled uniformly in resonance/softdrop mass and pT,
from a large mix of physics processes including ggH, Z+jets, and QCD from Run2UL2018 MC samples. The output classes of the DNN can be found in the `preprocess.json` file.
